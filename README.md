# Ping-Machines
by Erick Sevilla

Alright!

During the series we've covered some basics to get you started with PowerShell Scripting, in Episode 7 we wrote a very simple script, the challenge is to improve it, there's plenty of room, be it features, layout or best practices. If you are wondering how to achieve this, I left some suggestions and resources on Episode 7.

If you haven't watched the series, there's still time! You just need an hour and a cup of strong coffee to go through the whole 7 episodes!
